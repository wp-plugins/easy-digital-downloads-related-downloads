Automatically show related downloads by tag or category when using Easy Digital Downloads plugin.

== Description ==

**New since 1.5: option to choose sort order and orderby parameters.**

This is an extension for [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/) that automatically adds related downloads after the single download content on the single download page. It is simple and light. It works by default without a need for any settings. By default, 3 related downloads will be shown, related by download_tag. The title and featured image will be displayed, centered nicely. The related downloads are added right below the content of the single download.

**Optional - use it as widget**
It also adds a Related Downloads widget.

**Unobtrusive Styling - Fits right into your theme**

*   The featured images adopt your theme's style for `.wp-post-image`.
*	You can modify the image style with this selector: `#isa-related-downloads img `
*	Responsive CSS is included so it looks good on any size screen.

**Works automatically. No settings needed.**

This plugin has 6 optional settings. These options are located at `Downloads --> Settings --> Misc tab`.

1. Filter by Tag or Category
2. Change the number of related items to show
3. Custom Related Downloads Title
4. Disable Related Downloads From Being Added to Content
5. Change The Default Method of Sorting (Orderby)
6. Change The Default Sort Order

For more info, see the [Documentation](http://isabelcastillo.com/docs/category/easy-digital-downloads-related-downloads-wordpress-plugin).


**Languages**

- French
- Portuguese
- Spanish

It also includes a `.pot` file so you can easily translate into other languages.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `easy-digital-downloads-related-downloads.zip` directly into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

3. Optional: Go to `Downloads --> Settings --> Misc tab` to change the default settings.
4. Optional: Use the widget at `Appearances --> Widgets`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why aren't there any related downloads showing up on my single download page? =
Most likely, there are no other downloads that share that download's tag or category.

= I don't want them below my content. Can I use a template tag in single-download.php to position the related downloads wherever I want? =
Yes. Use WordPress's function `the_widget`. If you want the default output, use:

`the_widget('edd_related_downloads_widget');`

If you want to specify parameters for this instance, use:
`
	$inst = array( 
		'title' => 'You May Also Like',
		'number' => 3,
		'taxcat' => false,
	);
	the_widget('edd_related_downloads_widget', $inst, $args);`


However, the 2 above will style it just like the sidebar widget, which is list-style. If you want this to appear grid-style, like the default Related Downloads that get added below the content, you have to add the `$args` parameter, like so (you can change the $inst, but not the $args if you want grid-style):



`	$inst = array( 
		'title' => 'You May Also Like',
		'number' => 3,
		'taxcat' => false,
	);
	$args = array(
		'before_widget' => '<div id="isa-related-downloads" class="widget">',// make it grid-style
		'after_widget' => '</div>',
	);
	the_widget('edd_related_downloads_widget', $inst, $args);
`
